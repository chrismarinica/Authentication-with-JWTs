# Kanban Board Application

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Sequelize (PostgreSQL)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Styling:** Custom CSS (dark theme)
- **Deployment:** Render (for both frontend and backend)
- **API:** RESTful API for handling tasks and user authentication

## Features

  - Ability to create and update task details (e.g., title, description).

- **Responsive UI:**
  - Polished and responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.
